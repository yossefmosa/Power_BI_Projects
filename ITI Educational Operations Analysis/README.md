# 🎓 ITI Educational Operations Analysis  
Interactive Power BI Dashboards for Institutional Performance & Decision-Making

## 📌 Project Overview
To complement the structured SSRS reports and enable deeper, more flexible exploration of institutional data, a series of **interactive dashboards were developed using Power BI**.  
These dashboards provide **dynamic filtering**, **drill-down analysis**, and **real-time visualization** covering all key aspects of ITI’s educational and administrative operations.

The dashboards are built on top of the **central Data Warehouse (DWH)**, ensuring:
- Consistent and standardized reporting  
- Historical accuracy  
- Optimized performance for large datasets  
- Alignment with the organizational structure of the Information Technology Institute (ITI)
