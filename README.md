# Power BI Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Power BI projects repository!  
This collection showcases the dashboards and analytical solutions I developed throughout my learning journey, where I focused on **turning raw data into interactive dashboards, clear insights, and data-driven decisions**.  
Each project reflects my analytical thinking, design skills, and technical capabilities — all presented through **user-centered, visually engaging, and insight-driven dashboards**.

I aim to create Power BI reports that are not only informative, but also **intuitive, clean, and optimized for real decision-making**, with a strong focus on usability and user interaction.
